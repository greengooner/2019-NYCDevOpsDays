## Open Spaces - Day 1

* Docs for DevOps

# Docs for DevOps

* Understanding the processes is key
* Some use ServiceNow, Others Confluence (use other search or Algolia, Elastic Search, etc) or Jira
* Knowledge Management system for tracking quarterly changes to find stale docs, Someone suggested new hire reviews
* Management buy-in, Rewarding documentation should be rewarded immediately (someone suggested bonusly)
* Maintain documentenation as part of the source code, Sphynx document genearation
* PlantUML to generate graphs; Someone suggested that this format can be an issue with integration overtime, SVG drawing may be better and can cause issues with time.
* Don't start from blank, build from a form or template
* Starting new initatives require documenting via a form (examples of ServiceNow, Confluence, Jira)
* Ensure that the documenation exist for a reason and not just to document
* Suggested a plugin for Confluence that auto fades documentation based on a timeline for visual indication of when it needs to be updated
* Ensure that everyone can update the documetnation
