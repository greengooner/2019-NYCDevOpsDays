# Organizing for Your Ethical Principles

Based on a chapter in *Seeking SRE*

1. Why organize?
    * Working Conditions matter
        * Examples:
            * Pay and leveling
            * Unjust treatment
            * Excessive hours
            * Harassment/discrimination
            * Hostile work environment
    * Product Ethics
        * Examples:
            * Discriminating against minorities
                * Poor accessibility
                * Machine learning bias
            * Aiding in unlawful acts
                * Theranos (fraud)
                * La Liga (eavesdropping)
            * or both. May more
        * MUST AVOID DIGITAL VERSION OF REDLINING
    * Ethics of Tech Ecosystem
        * Examples:
            * "Independent" contractors & gig economy
            * Cafeteria & contingent workers
            * Gentrification
            * Tech lobbying
    * Intersections
        * Is it ok to ask someone to work on a project that harms or excludes them or harms or excludes members of a group they belong to?
        * Is it ok to subject external
    * Tech Ethical Crisis
        * Tech ethics focus has been insufficient and too late
        * Ethic codes are not enough
        * Not a trolley problem
        * Distal causes are not the issue
        * Examples:
            * ICE replaced ML algo with always detain
            * Far right info sharing on refugees in Germany
    * Your ethics matter
    * We've had a few successes
2. Your skills matter
    * Clearly Delegate Roles
        * Maintain clarity of command structure
        * Designate an Incident Commander
        * Designate clear roles for each participant
    * Learn from events
        * Blameless retros
        * Collective behavior and systems
        * Contrib factors
        * Why is this happening? not what did you do?
    * The St Pauls Principles
        * Do NOT naively assist law enforcement
3. Risks & Protections
    * Company Cultures
        * "Do Good" principles.
        * Companies claim to want vigorous sharing, debate & employees coming forward about issues.
        * Make use of your company's cultural statements
    * Industry Ethics Codes
    * Engineers are valuable
        * Replacing an engineer costs $x00,000
        * GDPR
        * Service Reliablility
        * Collective action & solidarity
    * Local Labor Laws
        * Labor laws may protect organizeing around working conditions & pay
        * Title 7 and NLRA in the US
            * Title 7 covers supervisors speaking out about discriminiation in their workplace
    * Whistleblowing
        * Generally, whistleblower protections are weak
        * Ethics != law; whistleblowing only colvers breaches of law
        * Risk of collateral damage
        * Be prepared to resign or lose your job
    * Be prepared for the worst
        * Remedies are retrospective
        * Retaliation often happens
        * What is your backup plan?
        * What is our collective plan?
        * To execs and managers: Is your company prepared to ethical escalations?
    * Change is worth the cost

    4. IDing Decision-Makers
