# Principles of Collaborative Automation

* DevOps - Its a situation
* The software is on the team: Editors, Pipelines, Build Tools, etc - all necessary for success
* Socio-technical system - Requires both people and techology to work
* Symbiotic - humans learning from the tech, the tech learning from the people who make it.
* Line of Represenation - Barrier of talking to learn vs. interfacing via software etc
* Automation depends on each other
* ...
* Basic Compact
    * Mutual purpose until furhter notice
    * Autopilot compensates until it can't
    * Automation must be monitored because situations can change and require human interaction to prevent failure.
    * Never swallow errors - Don't hide it from people who aren't end users
    * Rely on v. Work with - We work with each other, not rely on them to be perfect.
    * Work with teams and tools to provide reliability for those outside the team
    * As a service model means you can rely on it because of people operating it
* Mutually Predictable
    * Signal what you're doing and why
    * Diverse teams require mutually required standards for consistentcy
    * Don't use AI, ML, NLP in the automation
    * Software should explain why it provided a particular solution
    * Don't assume expertise, teach
* Mutually Directable
    * Plans are resources not law
    * Give choices not presume correct answers
    * Fewer options give the software more power and force a direction
    * Keep humans in charge
* Common Ground
    * Shared context and mental models
    * People maybe in the same meeting but one person may miss something others hear because they weren't focused but others can step in at the time of tasks; Difficult to automate for that kind of stuff.
    * Increased feedback necessary for increased complexity in the system
    * Communication is not message passing
* QA:
    * Abstract business complexity to increase capacity for technical complexity
    * Learn for each other on teams, helps address some complexity as long as there is an understanding of the goal for team for the business
    * Technical debt is more about adding to improve the system than anything else
    * The tools for devops automation should focus providing value for the dev and ops teams in the org, end users are different
